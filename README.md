# BilinearExtrapolation
A bilinear extrapolation method using level sets methods.
In this program, a surface is extrapolated from values where the surface is greater than zero to those in which the surface is less than zero. You can specify the surface in the main.cpp file. The program outputs the bin file, which you can read in using the matlab file.
